Limen [2019]</br>
</section>
<section class="limen">
Limen means threshold, understood as crossing, passage, link between two states.</br>
The missing chamber of the tumulus of Montecalvario, at the origin of my researches, recalls this place, non-place, of transition, changes, a shape, non-shape that still has to be invented, to be shaped, informed from the inside, a square that could still be filled with all possibilities.</br>

This space opens towards the eternity and thus gives a responsibility, too heavy to carry, to the shapes that it is projecting inside, therefore they are here shown as parts of a structure, of a rite of passage, that is itself only the threshold, its liminal, indeterminate phase.</br>

Triptych:</br>

Surface - depth – surface</br>

A run-through of the flesh and of the world.</br>

Imprint, skinning, being by negation.</br>
To mark the skin, to use one's own body as part of a technology to go beyond it, to go through the opacity of the skin.</br>
A descent Into the depths of the intimacy of the thoughts, of the memories.</br>
Is there an identity through time?</br>
The body, the voice, the memory are questioned as possible depositaries of this identity but they all seem to fail in this task.</br>
The voice piercing from the inside of the urn, reading randomly some notes written in the past is slowly decomposing and ends by becoming a noise a distant rumour, unintelligible, giving only shape to an architecture, a space of the non-identity.</br>

Fragments, pieces of oneself.</br>

The regime of visibility is constantly worked by a cyclic process of shapes that appear and disappear.</br>
The inside and the outside are “reciprocating” themselves, the surfaces are deep, the apparent body is haunted by the visceral, the skin by the entrails.</br>

The place is a skin that can be touched, a belly into which one can be engulfed, into which one can annihilate itself.</br>
